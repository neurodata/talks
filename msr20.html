## Lifelong Learning in AI

- Given a sequence of data associated with different tasks, .r[continually learn] such that task performances improve by virtue of having data from other tasks.
- Catastrophic forgetting:  learning new tasks causes performance .r[degradation] on previous tasks
- Why stop there? Let's .r[improve] performance on past tasks using future data


--

## Natural Intelligence

- Biological/natural intelligence (BI) is .r[progressive], data on future tasks can actually improve performance on past tasks:  
      - learning a 2nd language improves 1st language 
      - learning to run improves walking
- Each task is a composition of many sub-tasks which .r[overlap] with other tasks



---
class: inverse 

## Goals of this work 

- Formalize the above AI claims 
- Develop algorithms that move beyond catastrophic forgetting, motivated by observations from natural intelligence

### Background


---
class: inverse

## A simple learning example

- $z_i=(x_i,y_i)$, $i \in \lbrace 1, 2, \ldots, 200 \rbrace$
  - $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$
  - $y \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$
- we desire to learn a classifier that minimizes expected misclassification rate

## Last Year: A Grand Challenge

<br>

"We need to invent a new kind of learning that .r[leverages existing knowledge], rather than one that obstinately starts over from square one.”— Rebooting AI, Gary Marcus, Ernest Davis, 2019

<br>

"One such obstacle is adaptability or robustness...  efforts toward “transfer learning,” “domain adaptation,” and “.r[lifelong learning]”  are reflective of this obstacle." -- Judea Pearl, 2019

---
class: inverse 

## This Year: A Real Challenge 

- Industry
  - Microsoft/Amazon/Google trained a recommender system on existing products, then a new product is launched
- Healthcare
  - A new disease, test, treatment exists
- Augmented Reality
  - Walking around, go to a new city

In all cases, re-training from scratch is just too expensive, we desire to dynamically update  with new data

### A  Theory of the Lifelong Learnable




---
class: inverse

## What is Learning?

<img src="images/glivenko-cantelli.png" style="width:350px;"/>
<img src="images/Vapnik71b.png" style="width:350px;"/>
<img src="images/Valiant84.png" style="width:350px;"/>

## What is  Learning? 


"An agent $f$  learns from data $\mathcal{D}_n$  with performance measure $\mathcal{E}$, if $f$'s performance  improves with $n$.''


-- Tom Mitchell, 1997 (not exact quote)



---
class:inverse 

## What are data?

- Assume $Z_i$ is a $z \in \mathcal{Z}$ valued random variable
- Sample $Z_i \sim P \in \mathcal{P}$, identically and independently
- Let $\mathcal{D}=\lbrace Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \rbrace \in \, \mathcal{Z}^n$



--



- Example 1: Classification
  -  $Z_i = (X_i,Y_i)$ where $\mathcal{X}=\mathbb{R}^p$ and $\mathcal{Y}=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ 
  - $P=P\_{XY}=P\_{X|Y}P\_Y$, where $P\_{X|Y}$ is Gaussian


--


<!-- 

- Example 2: Reinforcment Learning
  - $Z$ is a sequence of states and actions + current state
  - $P$ a distribution over current states conditioned on 
      - past states 
      - past actions -->


---
class:inverse 


## What is an Algorithm?

$f$ is a  learning algorithm, which maps from a subset of data to a hypothesis $h$, 

$$f : 2^{\mathcal{Z}^N} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}, \text{ where }N \gg n.$$ 



--



- Example 1: Classification
  - $f$ is *RandomForestClassifier.fit*
  - $h$ is *RandomForestClassifier.predict*

<!-- TODO@ronak do i need both h and f? please make a compelling arguemtn for both yes and no :) -->


<!-- --



- Example 2: Reinforment Learning 
  - $f$
  - $h$ 
   -->


---
class:inverse 



## What is  Performance?

Generalization error $\mathcal{E}$ is the expected risk of algorithm $f$ for task $t$ with respect to training dataset size $n$:


$$ \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid t )  := \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} )  = \mathbb{E}\_P[\mathcal{R}(f(\mathcal{D}))].$$



--



Example 1: Classification
- $\mathcal{R}$ is expected misclassification rate



---
class:inverse

## What is Learning?

Letting $\mathcal{D}_0$ be a data corpus with no samples,


.center[$f$ learns from data $\mathcal{D}$ iff $\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}) < \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0),$]





$\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0)$ is the initial performance of $f$ prior to seeing data, and therefore a function of
  - prior on $\theta$ 
  - inductive bias of $\mathcal{H}$
  - estimation bias of $f$
  - model bias of $\mathcal{P}$





---
class:inverse

## What is a Setting?

A setting is defined by a septuple $\mathcal{S} = \lbrace \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A},  \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{F} \rbrace$

| Object | Notation | Example
|:--- |:--- |:--- | 
| Measurements  | $ \mathcal{Z}^n$ |  $\mathbb{R}^p \times \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$ |
| Distributions | $\mathcal{P} := \lbrace P_z \rbrace$ | Gaussian
| Actions |  $\mathcal{A}$ |  {↑,↓,←,←,B,A,start}
| Hypotheses  | $\mathcal{H} = \lbrace h: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathcal{A} \rbrace$  | hyperplanes
| Loss  | $\mathcal{L}: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}_+$  | $ (\hat{y} - y_*)^2$
| Risk  | $\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{L}  \to \mathbb{R}_+$  | $\mathbb{E}_P[ \mathcal{L}(a)]$
| Algorithms | $\mathcal{F} = \lbrace f : 2^{\mathcal{Z}^N} \to \mathcal{H} \rbrace$  | *RandomForest.fit*

---
class:inverse

## What is a Task?

Given 
- some true but unknown distribution $P\_z \in \mathcal{P}$, 
- a random data corpus $\mathcal{D}$ with sample size $n$
- a setting $\mathcal{S}$
<!-- - some (complexity) constraints on  $f \in \mathcal{F}$, $f: \mathcal{Z}^n  \to \mathcal{H}$: -->

find the $f \in \mathcal{F}$ that minimizes generalization error in that setting:

.center[ $f^* = \arg \min\_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D})$.]


---
class: inverse

## What is Transfer Learning? 


Given
- .r[source] data $\mathcal{D}_1$,  
- .r[target] data $\mathcal{D}_0$ from possibly another distribution.
- let $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_0 \cup \mathcal{D}_1$.


<!-- "An algorithm $f$  .r[transfer] learns from data $\mathcal{D}_j$  with respect to transfer learning task $t$ with performance measure $\mathcal{E}^t$, if $f$'s performance at task  $t$ improves  with $\mathcal{D}_j$." -->

--


.center[$f$ .r[transfer] learns  from $\mathcal{D}_1$ iff 
$\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}) < \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0).$]

## Can Honey Bees Transfer?


<img src="images/rock20/honeybee1.jpg" style="position:absolute; top:150px; width:80%; "/>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

- honey bees can also transfer to different sensory modality (smell)
- honeybees do not forget how to do the first task (no forgetting)
- this is called "forward transfer"
- bees learn the concept of "sameness"

      
---
class: inverse

## What is Multitask Learning? 


- $T_i \in \lbrace{1,2,..,J\rbrace}=[J]$ is a task lable, 
- Each task could differ by $P_z$ or any element of $\lbrace \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{F} \rbrace$
- $\mathcal{D} = \lbrace (Z_i,T_i) \rbrace^n $
<!-- - Sample $Z\_i \sim P :=P\_{XYT}$, identically and independently -->
- Let $\mathcal{D}_j = \lbrace (X_i,Y_i,T_i) :  T_i = j \rbrace$
<!-- - Let $\mathcal{D}= \mathcal{D}_1, \ldots , \mathcal{D}_J$ -->

--

$f$  weakly .r[multitask] learns from $\mathcal{D}$ if

$$  \sum\_{j \in [J]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j ) P(j) <  \sum\_{j \in [J]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j) P(j),$$ 

<br>


and $f$ strongly .r[multitask] learns if, 


$$ \frac{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j)}{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j)} > 1 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{J}.$$ 


<!-- TODO@jv add online learning here? f : mcF x 2^D^N -> h ? -->
---
class: inverse

## What is Sequential Learning? 

Same as "batch" learning, except $f$ updates existing hypothesis on basis of new data, that is, 


$$f : \mathcal{H} \times 2^{\mathcal{Z}^N} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}, \text{ where }N \gg n.$$ 



---
class: inverse

## What is Lifelong Learning? 

Sequential multi-task learning, where
- $|\mathcal{J}|$ is (countably) infinite
- $J_n$ is the number of tasks observed after $n$ samples
<!-- - Let $\mathcal{D}= \mathcal{D}\_1, \ldots , \mathcal{D}\_{J_n}$ -->

--

$f$  weakly .r[lifelong] learns from $\mathcal{D}$ if

$$  \sum\_{j \in [J\_n]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j ) P(T=j) <  \sum\_{j \in [J\_n]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}\_j \mid j) P(T=j),$$ 

<br>


and $f$ strongly .r[lifelong] learns if, 


$$ \frac{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j)}{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j)} > 1 \quad \forall j \in [J_n].$$

class:inverse 


###  Learning Scenarios

|             | $J>1$ | Sequential  | 
| :---:       | :---: | :---:       | 
| Machine     | 0 | 0 | 
| Sequential  | 0 | 1 |
| Multi-task  | 1 | 0 | 
| Lifelong    | 1 | 1 | 



---
class:inverse, middle 

### Evaluation Criteria


---
class:inverse

## Transfer Efficiency (TE)


The transfer efficiency of learning algorithm $f$ for task $j$ is
$$  TE\_j(f) := 
    \frac{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D}_j)}{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D_n})}.
$$

<br>

Algorithm $ f $ transfer learns if $ TE_j(f) > 1 $. 


---
class:inverse 

## Forward / Reverse TE 


- Let $\mathcal{D}_F^j = \{(X_i, Y_i, T_i) \in \, \mathcal{D} : i \leq n_j\}$ be the set of all data up to sample $n_j$.
- Forward transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data .r[preceding] task $j$
$$    FTE_j(f) := 
\frac{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D}_j)}{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D}_F^j)}.
$$

--


<!-- ## Reverse Transfer Efficiency -->


<!-- Reverse Transfer Efficiency (RTE) for task $j$ measures the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data occurring after the last sample $i$ with $T_i = j$.  -->


- Reverse transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data .r[after] task $j$ 


<!-- The reverse transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is  -->
$$    RTE\_j(f) := 
\frac{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D}_F^j)}{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D})}.
$$


---
class: inverse 

## Catastrophic Forgetting vs Reverse Transfer 

- Catastrophic forgetting: performance on past tasks gets much .r[worse] given new task data 
- Reverse transfer: performance on past tasks gets .r[better] given new task data


Wise learning machines cannot simply avoid catastrophic forgetting, them must reverse transfer to gain understanding from every sample.

---
class: inverse, middle 

### Algorithm



---
class: inverse 

## Composable Hypotheses 

.center[ .r[$h = v \circ u$]]

- Let $u$ be .r[transformer] data to a new representation, 

$$ u : \mathcal{Z} \to \tilde{\mathcal{Z}}$$

- Let $v$ be .r[voter] which operate on the transformed data 


$$ v : \tilde{\mathcal{Z}} \to \mathcal{A}$$


- Let $w$ be .r[decider] which decides which actions to take on the basis of the votes 


- $h=w(v(u(z)))$

---
class: inverse 


## Examples 

- .r[Transformers] $u$
  - Linear discriminant analysis: a projection onto a line 
  - Quadratic discriminant analysis: a projection onto a quadratic function 
  - Decision tree: a set non-overlapping of $p$-dimensional cuboids (polytopes)
  - Decision forest: a set of overlapping $p$-dimensional cuboids 
  - Neural network: $u$ is the "backbone", all the layers until the last layer 
--

- .r[Voters] $v$ 
   - threshold to report simply the most likely class 
   - posterior probability of any of the classes 
   - a softmax layer
--

- .r[Deciders] $w$
  - argmax over potential classes






---
class: inverse 


## Key Idea 

.r[.center[different transformers can be learned and each composed with voters]]

- learn many different transformers $u_j(\cdot)$'s
- for each $u\_j$, learn many different $v\_{j,j'}$'s
- use the decider to weight the various options 

$$w(  \cup\_{j'} v\_{j,j'}( \cup\_j u\_j(\cdot) )  )$$  $$= w(v\_{1,1}(u\_1(\cdot)) , v\_{1,2}( u\_1(\cdot)), \ldots v\_{J,J}( u\_J(\cdot)))$$

--

- Learn new representation for each task 
- Dimensionality of internal representation grows linearly with number of tasks
- This is .r[ensembling representations]


---
class: inverse 

## General Representations 

- Transformers learn representations 
- We desire representations that are sufficient for one task, and  useful for other tasks 
- Decision trees, decision forests, and deep nets (with ReLu nodes) partition feature space into polytopes

<!-- - They should be simple (eg, linear) for simple (eg, linear) tasks, and complicated for complicated task 
- LDA, QDA, and other parametric methods cannot naively do this 
- Decision trees, decision forests, can 
- Parametric deep nets cannot, non-parametric deep nets could 
--

- A .r[universal representation] is a representation that is potentially useful for any other task (eg, "spans the space") -->


<!-- ---
class: inverse

## Polytope Partitioning Representations -->

<img src="images/deep-polytopes.png" style="width:700px;"/>


<!-- - NNs with ReLu nodes  partitions feature space into  polytopes ([NIPS, 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5422-on-the-number-of-linear-regions-of-deep-neural-networks.pdf)). -->

<!-- TODO: add increasing complexity schema -->
<!-- TODO: change to progressive? -->

<!-- TODO: universal/general representation slide. LDA is ok, but if it mapped to 2 points, it would be useless -->

<!-- TODO@jv: implementation? forests? deep? polytopes? remove the next two slides -->


- Any learner with an explicit internal representation is ok, e.g.,  decision trees, decision forests, deep networks 
- SVM, k-NN, etc., are not

### Theory

class:inverse

## What do classifiers do?

<br>

learn: given $(x_i,y_i)$, for $i \in [n]$, where $y \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$
1. partition feature space into "parts",
2. compute plurality  of points in each part.


predict: given $x$
2. find its part, 
3. report the plurality vote in its part.


---
class:inverse

## What can regressors do?

<br>

learn: given $(x_i,y_i)$, for $i \in [n]$, where $y \in \mathbb{R}$
1. partition feature space into "parts",
2. compute average of points in each part.


predict: given $x$
2. find its part,
3. report the average vote in its part.

class:inverse

## The fundamental theorem of statistical pattern recognition



If each part is:

1. small enough, and 
2. has enough points in it, 

then given enough data, one can learn *perfectly, no matter what*! 


$$\mathcal{E}\(f,\mathcal{D}) \rightarrow \mathcal{E}^*,$$

where $\mathcal{E}^*$is Bayes optimal.

-- Stone, 1977


<!-- NB: the parts can be overlapping (as in kNN) or not (as in histograms) -->

## The fundamental .r[conjecture] of transfer learning


If each cell is:

- small enough, and 
- has enough points in it, 

then given enough data, one can .r[transfer learn] *perfectly, no matter what*!

### Discussion



---
class: inverse

##  Key Insights

  1. Avoiding catastrophic forgetting simply means reverse transfer is 1, but why stop there?
  2. Ensembling internal representations  enables reverse transfer > 1

---
class:inverse 

## Limitations 

2. Tasks must be discrete 
3. Data must be batched into tasks 
4. Tasks must be known 
5. Feature space must be the same for all tasks 
1. Internal representation grows linearly with # of tasks

## Do brains do it?

--

(brains obviously learn)

1. Do brains partition feature space?
2. Is there some kind of "voting" occurring within each part?


---
class: inverse

## Brains partition  

- Feature space = the set of all possible inputs to a brain
- Partition = only a subset of "nodes" respond to any given input
- Examples
  1. visual receptive fields
  2. place fields / grid cells
  3. sensory homonculus

class: inverse

## What is Lifelong Learning?

A computational system .r[lifelong learns] from data if, given a stream of data and tasks, data associated with one task is used to improve performance on both past and future tasks. 


Motivation: in biology, learning subsequent tasks often improves performance on previously learned tasks 


The key is learning internal representations of each data sample that is useful for multiple tasks


---
class: inverse

## Current State of the Art 

1. Used fixed architecture, finite capacity
2. Increase capacity, with complicated architecture 


---
class: inverse

## Our Approach 


1. Formally define lifelong learning as a generalization of single task machine learning, with suitable metrics 
2. Develop a generic lifelong learning approach, Omni-Directional Ensembling Representation (ODER)
  1. Learn a new representation for each task
  2. Ensemble all representations to make predictions 
3. Implement a specific example of this approach, Lifelong Forests 
4. Demonstrate that Lifelong Forests uniquely demonstrates lifelong learning



---
class: inverse

## Evaluation Criteria ("Metrics")


**Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only task-specific data, normalized by performance on the task including lots of other data.

**Forward Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only task-specific data, normalized by performance on the task including .r[all past data]. 

**Reverse Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only up until and including task-specific data, normalized by performance on .r[all data, both past and future].

--

If you don't reverse transfer, you haven't lifelong learned.


---
class:inverse 

.r[Lifelong Forests] uniquely exhibits reverse transfer.

class:inverse 

## Limitations 

1. Capacity grows linearly with # of tasks 
2. Tasks must be discrete 
3. Data must be batched into tasks 
4. Tasks must be known 
5. Feature space must be the same for all tasks

### Lifelong learning algorithms
- Fundamentally, a lifelong learning algorithm must summarize previous tasks via a useful representation to effectively use these tasks for learning a new task. 

- In supervised classification, the most useful representation of a task is its corresponding optimal decision boundary.

- More generally, tessellating space into cells yields a representation/compression valuable for any subsequence inference task.

---

### What are Decision Forests?

- Two things:
  1. a partitioning of the space into mutually exclusive cells 
  2. an assignment of probabilities  within each cell


- This is true for decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting trees, etc.	
  - Axis-aligned trees yield cells that are each right rectangular prisms (also called rectangular cuboids, rectangular parallelepiped, and orthogonal parallelipiped)	
  - Axis-oblique trees yield cells that are more general polytopes

Note: Deep Nets with ReLu activation function also tesselate space into polytopes  



---

### Key Algorithmic Insight 

- Cells of a partition of space can be a universal representation
- Partitions can be learned on a **per task** basis
- Probabilities can be estimated given **any** partition, including those from other tasks
- Use all data to estimate probabilities on the partitions learned separately for each task
- Average probabilities learned on each partition to obtain final answer


---
### Algorithm (High-Level)

- Input: $n$ points associated with $J$ different supervised classification/regression tasks
- Output: A classifier/regressor function for each task 
- Algorithm: 
      - for $j \in [J]$ 
        - Learn partition of space using only data from task $j$
        - Learn probabilities using partitions $1, \ldots, j$ 
        - Output average over all $j$ probability estimates 

--

  Notes:

- This exact procedure can be applied as $J$ continues to increase
- This procedure could be use any pair of algorithms for learning partitions and probabilities. 
- We focus on random forests for simplicity.
- We assumed related measurement spaces, specifically, $\mathcal{Z}\_j= \lbrace \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}\_j \rbrace$



---

### Basic L2M (unbounded storage)

<!-- Given the above assumptions, all lifelong learning algorithms can be characterized as follows. -->


For each $(z_t, j_t)$,
1. update .pu[transformer]  using all available data: $h\_t (\lbrace z\_t,j\_t \rbrace) \rightarrow \hat{f}\_t$ 
2. for each sample, apply .pu[transformer]: $\hat{f}\_t (z\_i) = \tilde{z}\_i$
3. for each  .pu[decider], update using all available data: 
      $g\_t (\lbrace \tilde{z}\_t,j\_t \rbrace) \rightarrow  \lbrace \hat{\eta}\_j \rbrace $
4. apply .pu[decider]: $\hat{\eta}\_{j\_t}(\tilde{z}\_t) \rightarrow a\_t$



---

### Basic L2M (bounded storage)



For each $(z_t, j_t)$,
1. update .pu[transformer]: $h\_t ( z\_t,j\_t, \hat{f}\_{t-1} ) \rightarrow \hat{f}\_t$ 
2. apply .pu[transformer]: $\hat{f}\_t (z\_t) = \tilde{z}\_t$
3. update all .pu[deciders]: 
      $g\_t ( \tilde{z}\_t,j\_t, \hat{\eta}\_{t-1} ) \rightarrow  \lbrace \hat{\eta}\_j \rbrace $
4. apply .pu[decider]: $\hat{\eta}\_{j\_t}(\tilde{z}\_t) \rightarrow a\_t$



---

### Lifelong  Forests 

- Assume data are batched into unique tasks
- For each task, $ z_t | j_t = j$
  1. Learn a new forest using data only from task $j_t$
  2. Apply forest to each observation so far 
  3. For each task, update plurality/average vote per tree 
  4. Apply average vote for $z_t$

### What is Universal Transfer Learning?

We say that $f$ **universally** transfers in setting $S$ iff 
$\exists \; \delta, n\_0 > 0$ such that $\forall n\_j > n\_0$:

<!-- $\forall n,n' > n\_0$, $\exists \; \delta > 0$ such that: -->



$\exists P,Q \in \mathcal{P}: TLE\_{n,n'}^{P,Q}(f) <  1 - \delta$ (sometimes better), and

$\forall P,Q \in \mathcal{P}: TLE\_{n,n'}^{P,Q}(f) \leq  1 + \delta$  (never much worse).


---

### What is Universal MT Learning?

We say that $f$ **universally** multi-task learns in settings $\vec{S}$ iff
$\exists \; \delta, n\_0 > 0$ such that $\forall n\_j > n\_0$:


$\exists \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}: MTE\_{\vec{n}}^{\vec{P}}(f) <  1 - \delta$  (sometimes better), and

$\forall \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}: MTE\_{\vec{n}}^{\vec{P}}(f) \leq  1 + \delta$ (never much worse).




---

### What is Universal Lifelong Learning?


We say that $f$ **universally** lifelong learns in settings $\vec{S}$ iff $\forall n\_j > n\_0$ and $\forall \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}$, lifelong learning holds.

### Machine Learning: Basic Set-Up

Given
1. A task $ T $ 
2. Observed data $ z\_1, z\_2, .., z\_n $

Assume
1. The $ z\_t $ are independent

---

### Constituents of  Learning Machines 

1.  .pu[representation]: data are transformed into a representation space
2.  .pu[transformer]: maps each point to the representation space
3.  .pu[decider]: takes an action using the transformed data

---

### Example 1 

Linear 2-class classification (we want to label black dot)

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_all_data.png" style="width:500px" class="center"/>


---
#### Example 1.1 - Linear Discriminant Analysis

1. .pu[representation]: the real number line 
2. .pu[transformer]: projection matrix that maps each feature vector onto real number line 
3. .pu[decider]: threshold such that values above threshold are one class, and below are the other

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_linear.jpg" style="width:600px" class="center"/>

<!-- diagram of linear classifier (projection from R^d to R then threshold) for two class, spherical gaussians -->
<!-- figure of problem -->
<!-- figure with representation -->
<!-- figure showing transformation of one data point to the line -->
<!-- figure showing decider acting on a the transformed data point -->

---

#### Example 1.2 - Decision Tree

1. .pu[representation]: a partition of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $
2. .pu[transformer]: maps a data point to a cell of the partition
3. .pu[deciders]: plurality (or average) of elements per cell

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml-tree.jpg" style="width:650px" class="center"/>

<!-- diagram of a partition for two class, spherical gaussians -->
<!-- figure of representation (partition) -->
<!-- figure of a data point in a cell of the partition -->
<!-- figure of classifying a data point in a cell of the partition -->

---

#### Example 1.3 - Decision Forests 

1. .pu[representation]: a set of partitions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ 
2. .pu[transformer]: maps a data point to a cell of each of the partitions
3. .pu[deciders]: average of decision trees (posterior probabilities)

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_forest.jpg" style="width:600px" class="center"/>

Each tree uses a different subset of data to transform (partition) space
