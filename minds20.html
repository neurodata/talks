Who is wise? He who learns from every man, as it is said: "From all who taught me have I gained understanding" 


-- Pirkei Avot 4:1

## What is Lifelong Learning 

Given a sequence of data associated with different tasks, continually learn such that task performances improve by virtue of having data from other tasks.

--

If learning a new task causes performance degradation on previous tasks, it is said that the algorithm exhibited "catastrophic forgetting"

--

.r[But, data on future tasks can actually improve performance on past tasks.]  

--

In general, tasks are complex, built of sub-tasks; if learning a new complex task can improve sub-task performance (including sub-tasks involved in previous tasks), then performance in previous tasks will improve too....



---


## Goals of this work 

- Formalize the above claims 
- Develop algorithms that move beyond catastrophic forgetting

### Background


---


## A simple learning example

- $z_i=(x_i,y_i)$, $i \in \lbrace 1, 2, \ldots, 200 \rbrace$
  - $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$
  - $y \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$
- we desire to learn a classifier that minimizes expected misclassification rate

## But there is a problem...


"Training on a new set of items may drastically disrupt performance on previously learned items."

## Last Year: A Grand Challenge

<br>

"We need to invent a new kind of learning that .r[leverages existing knowledge], rather than one that obstinately starts over from square one.”— Rebooting AI, Gary Marcus, Ernest Davis, 2019

<br>

"One such obstacle is adaptability or robustness...  efforts toward “transfer learning,” “domain adaptation,” and “.r[lifelong learning]”  are reflective of this obstacle." -- Judea Pearl, 2019

---


## This Year: A Real Challenge 

- Industry
  - Microsoft/Amazon/Google trained a recommender system on existing products, then a new product is launched, desire to update model to recommend for new products
- Healthcare
  - A new disease, test, treatment exists, want to update model
- Augmented Reality
  - Walking around, go to a new place, want to update model

In all cases, re-training from scratch is just too expensive.

### A  Theory of the Lifelong Learnable




---


## What is Learning?


<img src="images/Vapnik71b.png" style="width:400px;"/>
<img src="images/Valiant84.png" style="width:400px;"/>
<img src="images/Mitchell97a.png" style="width:400px;"/>

## What is  Learning? 


"An agent $f$  learns from data $\mathcal{D}_n$  with performance measure $\mathcal{E}$, if $f$'s performance  improves with $n$.''


-- Tom Mitchell, 1997 (not exact quote)



---


## What are data?

- Assume $Z_i$ is a $z \in \mathcal{Z}$ valued random variable
- Sample $Z_i \sim P \in \mathcal{P}$, identically and independently
- Let $\mathcal{D}=\lbrace Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \rbrace \in \, \mathcal{Z}^n$



--



- Example 1: Classification
  -  $Z_i = (X_i,Y_i)$ where $\mathcal{X}=\mathbb{R}^p$ and $\mathcal{Y}=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ 
  - $P=P\_{XY}=P\_{X|Y}P\_Y$, where $P\_{X|Y}$ is Gaussian


--




- Example 2: Reinforcment Learning
  - $Z$ is a sequence of states and actions + current state
  - $P$ a distribution over current states conditioned on 
      - past states 
      - past actions


---



## What is an Algorithm?

$f$ is a  learning algorithm, which maps from a subset of data to a hypothesis $h$, 

$$f : 2^{\mathcal{Z}^N} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}, \text{ where }N \gg n.$$ 



--



- Example 1: Classification
  - $f$ is *RandomForestClassifier.fit*
  - $h$ is *RandomForestClassifier.predict*



<!-- --



- Example 2: Reinforment Learning 
  - $f$
  - $h$ 
   -->


---
 



## What is  Performance?

Generalization error $\mathcal{E}$ is the expected risk of algorithm $f$ for task $t$ with respect to training dataset size $n$:


$$ \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid t )  := \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} )  = \mathbb{E}\_P[\mathcal{R}(f(\mathcal{D}))].$$


--

For example
- $\mathcal{R}$ is expected misclassification rate



---


## What is a Setting?

A setting is defined by a septuple $\mathcal{S} = \lbrace \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A},  \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{F} \rbrace$

| Definition | Notation | Example
|:--- |:--- |:--- | 
| Measurements  | $ \mathcal{Z}$ |  $(x,y) \in \, \mathbb{R}^p \times \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$ |
|  Model | $\mathcal{P} := \lbrace P_z \rbrace$ | Gaussian
| Action space |  $\mathcal{A}$ |  {U,D,L,R,A,B}
| Hypotheses  | $\mathcal{H} = \lbrace h: \mathcal{Z} \to \mathcal{A} \rbrace$  | hyperplanes
| Loss Function | $\mathcal{L}: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}_+$  | $ (a - y)^2$
| Risk Functional | $\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{L}  \to \mathbb{R}_+$  | $\mathbb{E}_P[ \mathcal{L}(a)]$
| Algorithm | $\mathcal{F} = \lbrace f : \mathcal{Z}^n \to \mathcal{H} \rbrace$  | *RandomForestClassifier.fit*

---


## What is a Task?

Given 
- some true but unknown distribution $P\_z \in \mathcal{P}$, 
- a sample size $n$,
<!-- - some (complexity) constraints on  $f \in \mathcal{F}$, $f: \mathcal{Z}^n  \to \mathcal{H}$: -->

find the $f \in \mathcal{F}$ that minimizes generalization error.

.center[ $f^* = \arg \min\_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_n)$.]

---


## What is Learning?

Letting $\mathcal{D}_0$ be a data corpus with no samples,


.center[$f$ learns from data $\mathcal{D}$ iff $\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}) < \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0),$]





$\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0)$ is the initial performance of $f$ prior to seeing data, and therefore a function of
  - prior on $\theta$ 
  - inductive bias of $\mathcal{H}$
  - estimation bias of $f$
  - model bias of $\mathcal{P}$





---


## What is Transfer Learning? 


Given
- .r[source] data $\mathcal{D}_1$,  
- .r[target] data $\mathcal{D}_0$ from possibly another distribution.
- let $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_0 \cup \mathcal{D}_1$.


<!-- "An algorithm $f$  .r[transfer] learns from data $\mathcal{D}_j$  with respect to transfer learning task $t$ with performance measure $\mathcal{E}^t$, if $f$'s performance at task  $t$ improves  with $\mathcal{D}_j$." -->

--


.center[$f$ .r[transfer] learns  from $\mathcal{D}_1$ iff 
$\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}) < \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_0).$]




---


## What is Multitask Learning? 


- $T_i \in \lbrace{1,2,..,J\rbrace}=[J]$ is a task lable, 
- Each task could differ by $P_z$ or any element of $\lbrace \mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{F} \rbrace$
- $\mathcal{D} :=\mathcal{D}_n= \lbrace (Z_i,T_i) \rbrace^n $]
<!-- - Sample $Z\_i \sim P :=P\_{XYT}$, identically and independently -->
- Let $\mathcal{D}_j = \lbrace (X_i,Y_i,T_i) :  T_i = j \rbrace$
<!-- - Let $\mathcal{D}= \mathcal{D}_1, \ldots , \mathcal{D}_J$ -->

--

$f$  weakly .r[multitask] learns from $\mathcal{D}$ if

$$  \sum\_{j \in [J]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j ) P(j) <  \sum\_{j \in [J]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j) P(j),$$ 

<br>


and $f$ strongly .r[multitask] learns if, 


$$ \frac{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j)}{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j)} > 1 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{J}.$$ 


---


## What is Lifelong Learning? 

Same as multitask learning, but...
- data arrived sequentially
- $|\mathcal{J}|$ is (countably) infinite
  - $J_n$ is the number of tasks observed after $n$ samples
<!-- - Let $\mathcal{D}= \mathcal{D}\_1, \ldots , \mathcal{D}\_{J_n}$ -->

--

$f$  weakly .r[lifelong] learns from $\mathcal{D}$ if

$$  \sum\_{j \in [J\_n]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j ) P(T=j) <  \sum\_{j \in [J\_n]} \mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}\_j \mid j) P(T=j),$$ 

<br>


and $f$ strongly .r[lifelong] learns if, 


$$ \frac{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D}_j \mid j)}{\mathcal{E}(f,\mathcal{D} \mid j)} > 1 \quad \forall j \in [J_n].$$ 





---
class: middle 

### Evaluation Criteria


---


## Transfer Efficiency (TE)


The transfer efficiency of learning algorithm $f$ for task $j$ is
$$  TE\_j(f) := 
    \frac{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D}_j)}{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D_n})}.
$$

<br>

Algorithm $ f $ transfer learns if $ TE_j(f) > 1 $. 


---
 

## Forward / Reverse TE 


- Let $\mathcal{D}_F^j = \{(X_i, Y_i, T_i) \in \, \mathcal{D} : i \leq n_j\}$ be the set of all data up to sample $n_j$.
- Forward transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data .r[preceding] task $j$
$$    FTE_j(f) := 
\frac{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D}_j)}{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D}_F^j)}.
$$

--


<!-- ## Reverse Transfer Efficiency -->


<!-- Reverse Transfer Efficiency (RTE) for task $j$ measures the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data occurring after the last sample $i$ with $T_i = j$.  -->


- Reverse transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is the improvement on task $j$ resulting from all data .r[after] task $j$ 


<!-- The reverse transfer efficiency of $ f $ for task $j$ is  -->
$$    RTE\_j(f) := 
\frac{\mathcal{E}\_j(f, \mathcal{D}_F^j)}{\mathcal{E}_j(f, \mathcal{D})}.
$$


---
 

## Catastrophic Forgetting vs Reverse Transfer 

- Catastrophic forgetting: performance on past tasks gets much .r[worse] given new task data 
- Reverse transfer: performance on past tasks gets .r[better] given new task data


Wise learning machines cannot simply avoid catastrophic forgetting, them must reverse transfer to gain understanding from every sample.

class: middle 

### Algorithm


<!-- ---
 

## A Concrete Setting  


- Let $\mathcal{X}^i=\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^p$ (feature spaces are the same $p$-dimensional Euclidean space)
- Let $\mathcal{Y}_i$ be categorical with $K_i$ categories (always classification)
- Assume data are "task batched", that is, samples $n, \ldots, n+n_j$ all come from task $j$
- Risk is expected misclassification rate -->



---
 


## Key Idea 

- Learn new representation for each task 
- Learn classifier for each task on each representation
- .r[Ensemble representations]
- Dimensionality of internal representation grows linearly with number of tasks



---
 

## Lifelong Learning Schema


<img src="images/learning-schemas.svg" style="width:700px;"/>

<!-- TODO: add increasing complexity schema -->


---
 

## Lifelong.Fit

Given a new training dataset  $\mathcal{D}_J$
- Learn a new representation transformation  on that dataset 

$$g^J: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \tilde{\mathcal{X}}^J$$

- Apply $J^{th}$ transformation to all $n$ samples 

$$\forall \, i \in [n], \qquad   g^J(X_i) \rightarrow \tilde{X}_i^J$$


- Learn class-conditional posteriors on  $J^{th}$ representations for each task

$$ \forall \, j \in [J] \qquad  h^j : \tilde{\mathcal{X}}^J \rightarrow \hat{\eta}(\cdot | J \rightarrow j)$$


---
 

## Lifelong.Predict 


Given a  test sample from task $j'$ 

- Apply $J$ transformations to sample $n+1$

$$\forall \, j \in [J], \qquad   g^j(X) \rightarrow \tilde{X}^j$$

- Evaluate $J$ posteriors for sample $n+1$

$$\forall \, j \in [J], \qquad   h^{j'}(\tilde{X}^j) \rightarrow \hat{\eta}(X | j \rightarrow j')$$


- Compute max of average of $J$ class posteriors  

$$ \hat{Y}\_{n+1} = \arg \max \frac{1}{J} \sum\_j^J \hat{\eta}(X | j \rightarrow j') $$

### Real Data

## Consider an  example

- *CIFAR 100* is a popular image classification dataset with 100 classes of images. 
- CIFAR 10x10 breaks the 100-class task problem into 10 tasks, each with 10-class.
- 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
- All images are 32x32 color images.

## Reverse Transfer Efficiency

- y-axis indicates .r[reverse transfer efficiency] (RTE), 
  - which is the ratio of "single task error" to "error using future tasks"
- each task will have a line
  - if the line .r[increases], that means it is doing "reverse transfer"

.r[Lifelong Forests] uniquely exhibits reverse transfer.

### Theory


---


## What do classifiers do?

<br>

learn: given $(x_i,y_i)$, for $i \in [n]$, where $y \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$
1. partition feature space into "parts",
2. compute plurality  of points in each part.


predict: given $x$
2. find its part, 
3. report the plurality vote in its part.


---


## What can regressors do?

<br>

learn: given $(x_i,y_i)$, for $i \in [n]$, where $y \in \mathbb{R}$
1. partition feature space into "parts",
2. compute average of points in each part.


predict: given $x$
2. find its part,
3. report the average vote in its part.




---


## The fundamental theorem of statistical pattern recognition



If each part is:

1. small enough, and 
2. has enough points in it, 

then given enough data, one can learn *perfectly, no matter what*! 


$$\mathcal{E}\(f,\mathcal{D}) \rightarrow \mathcal{E}^*,$$

where $\mathcal{E}^*$is Bayes optimal.

-- Stone, 1977


<!-- NB: the parts can be overlapping (as in kNN) or not (as in histograms) -->



---


## The fundamental .r[conjecture] of transfer learning


If each cell is:

- small enough, and 
- has enough points in it, 

then given enough data, one can .r[transfer learn] *perfectly, no matter what*!

### Discussion



---


##  Key Insights

  1. Avoiding catastrophic forgetting simply means reverse transfer is 1, but why stop there?
  2. Ensembling internal representations  enables reverse transfer > 1

---
 

## Limitations 

2. Tasks must be discrete 
3. Data must be batched into tasks 
4. Tasks must be known 
5. Feature space must be the same for all tasks 
1. Internal representation grows linearly with # of tasks 
      
      



---


##  Key Accomplishments


- Formalized Lifelong Learning as generalization of classical machine learning
- Introduced novel evaluation criteria: forward and reverse transfer efficiency
- Proposed generic lifelong learning algorithm framework by ensembling internal representations
- Implemented Lifelong Forests as a specific example 
- Demonstrated Lifelong Forests uniquely exhibits 
    - reverse transfer 
    - stong lifelong learning
- Conjectured theory promising to prove consistency and robustness

# Biology

## Do brains do it?

--

(brains obviously learn)

1. Do brains partition feature space?
2. Is there some kind of "voting" occurring within each part?


---


## Brains partition  

- Feature space = the set of all possible inputs to a brain
- Partition = only a subset of "nodes" respond to any given input
- Examples
  1. visual receptive fields
  2. place fields / grid cells
  3. sensory homonculus

<img src="images/rock20/Rear_of_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg" style="height:230px;"/>


---


## Brains vote

- Vote = pattern of responses indicate which stimulus evoked response

## Can Honey Bees Transfer Learn?


<img src="images/rock20/honeybee1.jpg">

- honey bees can also transfer to different sensory modality (smell)
- honeybees do not forget how to do the first task
- this is called "forward transfer"
- bees learn the concept of "sameness"

## Can Humans Reverse Transfer?


- "Knowledge and skills from a learner’s first language are used and reinforced, deepened, and expanded upon when a learner is engaged in second language literacy tasks." -- [American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages](https://www.actfl.org/guiding-principles/literacy-language-learning)



---
 

## Proposed Experiments 

- Behavioral Experiment
  - Source Task: Delayed Match to Sample (DMS) on colors
  - Target Task A: Delayed Match to Not-Sample  on colors 
  - Target Task B: DMS on orientation 
- Measurements
  - Arc-GFP to identify which neurons could learn 
  - Ca2+-YFP to measure neural activity
  - Narp-RFP to identify which neurons actually consolidate
- Species 
      - Zebrafish (Engert)
      - Mouse (McNaughton and/or Tolias)
      - Human (Isik)

# Summary

## What is Lifelong Learning?

A computational system .r[lifelong learns] from data if, given a stream of data and tasks, data associated with one task is used to improve performance on both past and future tasks. 


---


## What is Lifelong Learning?

A computational system .r[lifelong learns] from data if, given a stream of data and tasks, data associated with one task is used to improve performance on both past and future tasks. 


Motivation: in biology, learning subsequent tasks often improves performance on previously learned tasks 


The key is learning internal representations of each data sample that is useful for multiple tasks


---


## Current State of the Art 

1. Used fixed architecture, finite capacity
2. Increase capacity, with complicated architecture 


---


## Our Approach 


1. Formally define lifelong learning as a generalization of single task machine learning, with suitable metrics 
2. Develop a generic lifelong learning approach, Omni-Directional Ensembling Representation (ODER)
  1. Learn a new representation for each task
  2. Ensemble all representations to make predictions 
3. Implement a specific example of this approach, Lifelong Forests 
4. Demonstrate that Lifelong Forests uniquely demonstrates lifelong learning



---


## Evaluation Criteria ("Metrics")


**Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only task-specific data, normalized by performance on the task including lots of other data.

**Forward Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only task-specific data, normalized by performance on the task including .r[all past data]. 

**Reverse Transfer Efficiency**: Performance on a task with only up until and including task-specific data, normalized by performance on .r[all data, both past and future].

--

If you don't reverse transfer, you haven't lifelong learned.


---
 

.r[Lifelong Forests] uniquely exhibits reverse transfer.


<img src="images/cifar-rte.png" style="height:530px;" />


---
 

## Limitations 

1. Capacity grows linearly with # of tasks 
2. Tasks must be discrete 
3. Data must be batched into tasks 
4. Tasks must be known 
5. Feature space must be the same for all tasks

## Polytope space partitioning algorithms


<img src="images/deep-polytopes.png" style="width:750px;"/>


- NNs with ReLu nodes also partitions feature space into  polytopes ([NIPS, 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5422-on-the-number-of-linear-regions-of-deep-neural-networks.pdf)).



---

### RF is more computationally efficient 


<img src="images/s-rerf_6plot_times.png" style="width:750px;"/>


---



### Lifelong learning algorithms
- Fundamentally, a lifelong learning algorithm must summarize previous tasks via a useful representation to effectively use these tasks for learning a new task. 

- In supervised classification, the most useful representation of a task is its corresponding optimal decision boundary.

- More generally, tessellating space into cells yields a representation/compression valuable for any subsequence inference task.

---

### What are Decision Forests?

- Two things:
  1. a partitioning of the space into mutually exclusive cells 
  2. an assignment of probabilities  within each cell


- This is true for decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting trees, etc.	
  - Axis-aligned trees yield cells that are each right rectangular prisms (also called rectangular cuboids, rectangular parallelepiped, and orthogonal parallelipiped)	
  - Axis-oblique trees yield cells that are more general polytopes

Note: Deep Nets with ReLu activation function also tesselate space into polytopes  



---

### Key Algorithmic Insight 

- Cells of a partition of space can be a universal representation
- Partitions can be learned on a **per task** basis
- Probabilities can be estimated given **any** partition, including those from other tasks
- Use all data to estimate probabilities on the partitions learned separately for each task
- Average probabilities learned on each partition to obtain final answer


---
### Algorithm (High-Level)

- Input: $n$ points associated with $J$ different supervised classification/regression tasks
- Output: A classifier/regressor function for each task 
- Algorithm: 
      - for $j \in [J]$ 
        - Learn partition of space using only data from task $j$
        - Learn probabilities using partitions $1, \ldots, j$ 
        - Output average over all $j$ probability estimates 

--

  Notes:

- This exact procedure can be applied as $J$ continues to increase
- This procedure could be use any pair of algorithms for learning partitions and probabilities. 
- We focus on random forests for simplicity.
- We assumed related measurement spaces, specifically, $\mathcal{Z}\_j= \lbrace \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}\_j \rbrace$



---

### Basic L2M (unbounded storage)

<!-- Given the above assumptions, all lifelong learning algorithms can be characterized as follows. -->


For each $(z_t, j_t)$,
1. update .pu[transformer]  using all available data: $h\_t (\lbrace z\_t,j\_t \rbrace) \rightarrow \hat{f}\_t$ 
2. for each sample, apply .pu[transformer]: $\hat{f}\_t (z\_i) = \tilde{z}\_i$
3. for each  .pu[decider], update using all available data: 
      $g\_t (\lbrace \tilde{z}\_t,j\_t \rbrace) \rightarrow  \lbrace \hat{\eta}\_j \rbrace $
4. apply .pu[decider]: $\hat{\eta}\_{j\_t}(\tilde{z}\_t) \rightarrow a\_t$



---

### Basic L2M (bounded storage)



For each $(z_t, j_t)$,
1. update .pu[transformer]: $h\_t ( z\_t,j\_t, \hat{f}\_{t-1} ) \rightarrow \hat{f}\_t$ 
2. apply .pu[transformer]: $\hat{f}\_t (z\_t) = \tilde{z}\_t$
3. update all .pu[deciders]: 
      $g\_t ( \tilde{z}\_t,j\_t, \hat{\eta}\_{t-1} ) \rightarrow  \lbrace \hat{\eta}\_j \rbrace $
4. apply .pu[decider]: $\hat{\eta}\_{j\_t}(\tilde{z}\_t) \rightarrow a\_t$



---

### Lifelong  Forests 

- Assume data are batched into unique tasks
- For each task, $ z_t | j_t = j$
  1. Learn a new forest using data only from task $j_t$
  2. Apply forest to each observation so far 
  3. For each task, update plurality/average vote per tree 
  4. Apply average vote for $z_t$

### What is Universal Transfer Learning?

We say that $f$ **universally** transfers in setting $S$ iff 
$\exists \; \delta, n\_0 > 0$ such that $\forall n\_j > n\_0$:

<!-- $\forall n,n' > n\_0$, $\exists \; \delta > 0$ such that: -->



$\exists P,Q \in \mathcal{P}: TLE\_{n,n'}^{P,Q}(f) <  1 - \delta$ (sometimes better), and

$\forall P,Q \in \mathcal{P}: TLE\_{n,n'}^{P,Q}(f) \leq  1 + \delta$  (never much worse).


---

### What is Universal MT Learning?

We say that $f$ **universally** multi-task learns in settings $\vec{S}$ iff
$\exists \; \delta, n\_0 > 0$ such that $\forall n\_j > n\_0$:


$\exists \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}: MTE\_{\vec{n}}^{\vec{P}}(f) <  1 - \delta$  (sometimes better), and

$\forall \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}: MTE\_{\vec{n}}^{\vec{P}}(f) \leq  1 + \delta$ (never much worse).




---

### What is Universal Lifelong Learning?


We say that $f$ **universally** lifelong learns in settings $\vec{S}$ iff $\forall n\_j > n\_0$ and $\forall \vec{P} \in \vec{\mathcal{P}}$, lifelong learning holds.

1. A task $ T $ 
2. Observed data $ z\_1, z\_2, .., z\_n $

Assume
1. The $ z\_t $ are independent

---

### Constituents of  Learning Machines 

1.  .pu[representation]: data are transformed into a representation space
2.  .pu[transformer]: maps each point to the representation space
3.  .pu[decider]: takes an action using the transformed data

### Example 1 

Linear 2-class classification (we want to label black dot)

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_all_data.png" style="width:500px" class="center"/>


---
#### Example 1.1 - Linear Discriminant Analysis

1. .pu[representation]: the real number line 
2. .pu[transformer]: projection matrix that maps each feature vector onto real number line 
3. .pu[decider]: threshold such that values above threshold are one class, and below are the other

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_linear.jpg" style="width:600px" class="center"/>

<!-- diagram of linear classifier (projection from R^d to R then threshold) for two class, spherical gaussians -->
<!-- figure of problem -->
<!-- figure with representation -->
<!-- figure showing transformation of one data point to the line -->
<!-- figure showing decider acting on a the transformed data point -->

---

#### Example 1.2 - Decision Tree

1. .pu[representation]: a partition of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $
2. .pu[transformer]: maps a data point to a cell of the partition
3. .pu[deciders]: plurality (or average) of elements per cell

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml-tree.jpg" style="width:650px" class="center"/>

<!-- diagram of a partition for two class, spherical gaussians -->
<!-- figure of representation (partition) -->
<!-- figure of a data point in a cell of the partition -->
<!-- figure of classifying a data point in a cell of the partition -->

---

#### Example 1.3 - Decision Forests 

1. .pu[representation]: a set of partitions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ 
2. .pu[transformer]: maps a data point to a cell of each of the partitions
3. .pu[deciders]: average of decision trees (posterior probabilities)

<img src="images/l2m_18mo/cml_forest.jpg" style="width:600px" class="center"/>

Each tree uses a different subset of data to transform (partition) space
