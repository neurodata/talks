## list of projects 

- description, goal, next 
- people/teams that claim one means that they will work on it and be first author on paper that we write about it this year 
- will involve some data munging, some analysis, possibly some novel methods development
- will be the top research priority for people who claim it
- will visit the data generators in next month or so to get more details / make more plans
- goal is to submit nature paper nlt end of calendar year

### Satterthwaite Irritation (pitt)

- human dMRI graphs provided
- ~100 subjects 
- age, sex, irritation provided 

<br>
- goal: find signal subgraph with > chance accuracy
- next: run different signal subgraph codes on data 

.footnote[guodong?]


---

### Satterthwaite Multiview biclustering (pitt)

- several hundred humans 
- multiple views of each, including structural brain imaging, dMRI, psychiatric evaluation 

<br>

- goal: learn an interpretable joint embedding
- next: get data, start writing what to do on whiteboard, consider both RF-based on linear-based methods


---

### kiehl (new mexico)

- human strucual MRI & derived features 
- ~500 subjects 
- age, sex, {murderer, violent non-murderer, non-violent}

<br>


- goal: classification > 0.55 accuracy 
- next: run RerF on data


.footnote[alex?]


---

### tolias (baylor/houston)

- mouse single cell ophys 
- $>$6,300 cells
- 40k time steps 
- time-varying stimulus

<br>


- goal: estimate time-varying intrinsic dimension and/or amount of information brain data has about stimulus
- next: run URerF on data, 
- next: extend RerF to support multivariate regression 

.footnote[meghana?]


---

### hillman (columbia)

- mouse wide field ophys
- 512 x 512 times for several thousand time steps 
- i don't think we have stimulus 

<br>


- goal: estimate time-varying intrinsic dimension and/or amount of information brain data has about stimulus
- next: parallel/distributed implementation of RerF/URerF 

.footnote[meghana?]

---

### honey  (jhu)

- 2 human fMRI datasets, each with ~200 ROIs and ~200 time-steps
- we could get stimulus 

<br>


- goal: estimate time-varying intrinsic dimensions and/or amount of information brain data has about stimulus
- next: run URerF on data

.footnote[meghana?]


---

### c elegans (einstein in nyc)

- 2 sexes, 2 connectomes each 
- brain across sexes are partially matched 
- cell lineage for each neuron 

<br>


- goal: hclust graph in such a way to "matches" lineage 
- next: run hclust on data


.footnote[pedigo?]

---

### drosophila model selection (janelia/cambridge)

- 2 mushroom bodies (left and right) 
- left and right not perfectly matched 

<br>


- goal: model selection 
- next: get updated data from michael winding 


.footnote[pedigo?]


---

### drosophila bilateral homology (janelia/cambridge)

- left and right mushroom bodies 

<br>


- goal: test whether left is equivalent to right 
- next: get up to date on me + cep + brandon results 


.footnote[pedigo?]

---

### HCP data (milham, nyc)

- ~1000 subjects human dMRI graphs 
- mono, di, sib

<br>


- goal: quantify heritability 
- next: update draft? formalize our notion of heritability? is it  discriminability?

.footnote[jaewon]


---

### sea lion and coyote  (berns, atlana / milham, nyc)

- 4 sea lions and 4 coyotes 
- dMRI graph and atlas from each 

<br>


- goal: compare and contrast 
- next: do it 

.footnote[nobody?]


---

### brazilian child study (milham, nyc)

- several thousand kids 
- PRS for each 
- some brain imaging data for each 

<br>


- goal: determine which "features" of brain data are associated with which PRS
- next: get data into "shape"

.footnote[nobody?]


---

### human cci (milham, nyc)

- HBN + HCP data including dMRI covariates
- run signal subgraph on one dataset to find signal subgraph for some covariate 
- once found for one dataset, run the same exact code on the other dataset, to find approximately same signal subgraph 

<br>


goal: find signal subgraph robust to site specific batch effects
next: get data organized 

.footnote[nobody?]


---

### some sebastian data  (sebastian, princeton)

- connectome of something, unclear the details 


<br>

- goal: help them cluster (not first author)
- next: schedule time to visit 

.footnote[nobody?]


---

### some jeff data  (jeff, harvard)

- connectome of something, unclear the details 


<br>

- goal: help them cluster (not first author)
- next: schedule time to visit 


.footnote[nobody?]

---

### developmental c. elegans (samuel, harvard)

- connectome of c. elegans at multiple developmental stages 


<br>

- goal: anything (unclear if 1st author)
- next: schedule time to visit 

.footnote[nobody?]

logistics

- would be at kavli 
- i'd get money for food 
- people will pay for travel/lodging 
- would need committment from
      - one person to run each day
      - one person to run overall thingy 
- would have to start planning asap 
- would have to find a week that works for those committed asap
